# Pygame-Auchtung-die-kurve Overview

With this pygame I have two players that can play with eachother and random powerups that spawn throughout the game that slow the player down, making it easier to avoid other lines. The game ends when a player hits a wall or another player's line. The game is a take on the game Auchtung die kurve, which is a game where you try to avoid other lines and stay alive the longest.

There are two different players by default. The Red player's controls are the keys "Q" and "W", the Blue players controls are the "Left" and "Right" arrow keys.

My goal in writing this game is to get a better understanding of how game engines work and how to use pygame. I also wanted to learn how to use classes and objects in python. I also wanted to learn how to use github and how to use it to collaborate with others.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used in this are the libraries pygame and random. I also used the IDE VSCode to write the code. I used github to store my code and to collaborate with others.

# Future Work

* Add different types of powerups
* Add support for more than 2 players
* Add an AI that can play against the player when there's only one player
* Reformat class structure for better intuition (ex: move all powerup logic into the powerup class)
